# Christmas Cookie Store
the store for selling only the best Christmas cookies

## Description

The Christmas Cookie Store started as a class project, but over time has evolved into a mini personal project for me. The application was built with heavy focus put on the mobile experience and looks.

Despite its small size and focus on looks, the application boasts features commonly found in eatery applications. Users can select a cookie by scrolling through the list of cookies available. They can then select the number of cookies and include any add-ons they would like. If errors were made, modification can be done by updating or deleting the cookie in the cart. Finally, they can simulate checkout by going to the payment page.
