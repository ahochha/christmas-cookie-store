# Christmas Cookie Store
The store for selling only the best Christmas cookies! The Christmas Cookie Store started as a group project in SDSU's Human Factors and User Interfaces course, but over time has evolved into a mini personal project for me. The application was built with heavy focus put on the mobile experience and looks.

## Features

Despite its small size and focus on looks, the application boasts features commonly found in eatery applications.
