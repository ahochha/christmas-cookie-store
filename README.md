# Christmas Cookie Store
The store for selling only the best Christmas cookies! The Christmas Cookie Store started as a group project in SDSU's Human Factors and User Interfaces course, but over time has evolved into a mini personal project for me. The application was built with heavy focus put on the mobile experience and looks.

## Usage and Features

Despite its small size and focus on looks, the application boasts features commonly found in eatery applications. 

Users can:
* Select a cookie by scrolling through the list of cookies available
* For a specific cookie, select the quantity and include any add-ons they would like
* Correct any mistakes by modifying or deleting cookies in the cart (tap the cookie to make changes to it)
* Simulate checkout by going to the payment page
